# Text Highlighting Feature

## Overview

The PraisonAI PPT - PowerPoint Bible Verses Generator now supports **highlighting specific words or phrases** within verses. Highlighted text appears in **bold orange color** to make key concepts stand out in your presentations.

## How to Use Highlights

### JSON Format

Add a `"highlights"` array to any verse in your JSON file:

```json
{
  "reference": "John 3:16 (NIV)",
  "text": "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.",
  "highlights": ["loved", "eternal life"]
}
```

### Highlights Array

The `"highlights"` field is **optional** and accepts an array of strings:
- Each string can be a **single word** or a **phrase**
- Matching is **case-insensitive** (e.g., "loved" matches "loved" or "Loved")
- Multiple occurrences of the same word/phrase will all be highlighted
- Overlapping highlights are automatically handled

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Single Word Highlights

```json
{
  "reference": "Philippians 4:13 (NIV)",
  "text": "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.",
  "highlights": ["Christ", "strengthens"]
}
```

**Result**: "Christ" and "strengthens" appear in bold orange.

### Example 2: Phrase Highlights

```json
{
  "reference": "Jeremiah 29:11 (NIV)",
  "text": "For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.",
  "highlights": ["hope and a future", "plans"]
}
```

**Result**: The phrase "hope and a future" and all occurrences of "plans" are highlighted.

### Example 3: Multiple Highlights

```json
{
  "reference": "Romans 8:28 (NIV)",
  "text": "And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.",
  "highlights": ["all things", "good", "purpose"]
}
```

**Result**: Three different words/phrases are highlighted.

### Example 4: No Highlights (Optional)

```json
{
  "reference": "Psalm 23:1 (KJV)",
  "text": "The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want."
}
```

**Result**: Normal text without any highlighting (highlights field is optional).

## Tips and Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Do:
- Highlight **key theological terms** (e.g., "grace", "faith", "love")
- Highlight **important phrases** (e.g., "eternal life", "born again")
- Use highlights **sparingly** (2-4 per verse maximum)
- Highlight **consistent themes** across multiple verses

### ‚ùå Don't:
- Highlight too many words (reduces impact)
- Highlight entire sentences (defeats the purpose)
- Use highlights for every verse (makes them less special)
- Highlight common words like "the", "and", "is"

---

## Technical Details

### Case-Insensitive Matching
The highlighting system uses case-insensitive matching:
- `"love"` will match "love", "Love", "LOVE"
- Original case from the verse is preserved in the output

### Overlapping Highlights
If highlights overlap, the first occurrence takes precedence:
- Highlights: `["all things", "things"]`
- Text: "all things work together"
- Result: Only "all things" is highlighted (not "things" separately)

### Special Characters
Special regex characters in highlights are automatically escaped:
- You can highlight phrases with punctuation: `"God's love"`
- Parentheses, brackets, etc. are handled correctly

### Long Verses
Highlights work seamlessly with split verses:
- If a verse is split across multiple slides, highlights apply to each part
- The same highlight rules apply to all parts

---

## Example Files

Check these example files in the `examples/` directory:

1. **`highlights_example.json`** - Demonstrates various highlighting techniques
2. **`template.json`** - Shows the highlights field in the template
3. **`only_one_reason_sickness.json`** - Can be updated to include highlights

---

## Customization (Advanced)

If you want to customize the highlight color or style, edit `praisonaippt/core.py`:

```python
# In the _apply_highlights function, find this line:
run.font.color.rgb = RGBColor(255, 140, 0)  # Orange

# Change to your preferred color:
run.font.color.rgb = RGBColor(255, 0, 0)    # Red
run.font.color.rgb = RGBColor(0, 128, 0)    # Green
run.font.color.rgb = RGBColor(0, 0, 255)    # Blue
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Highlights Not Appearing
- ‚úÖ Check JSON syntax (highlights must be an array)
- ‚úÖ Verify the text matches exactly (case-insensitive)
- ‚úÖ Ensure the word/phrase exists in the verse text

### Wrong Text Highlighted
- ‚úÖ Check for typos in the highlights array
- ‚úÖ Remember matching is case-insensitive
- ‚úÖ Use exact phrases (including spaces)

### Too Many Highlights
- ‚úÖ Reduce the number of highlights per verse
- ‚úÖ Focus on the most important concepts
- ‚úÖ Consider splitting into multiple slides
